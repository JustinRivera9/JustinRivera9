- 👋 Hi, I’m @JustinRivera9
- 👀 I’m interested in learning the fundamentals of writing and understanding code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all the basics.
- 💞️ I decided to start learning how to code because I've always been interested in technology and am in need of a career change. I also started a tech company where none of us (Founders) were technical. Obviously that's a big problem so I decided if I ever start another one in the future I want to be the technical person (We just launched. Looking for the "CTO" position currently).
- 📫 You can reach me at JustinRivera@CardCrusade.com
